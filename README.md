### He's coming...

We will launch our testnet soon!

While you can enjoy our current testnet at https://dev.croblanc.com, we will finish the GitHub and Git Books work.

Contracts ABIs, deployement addresses, and code skeletons will be published before the mainnet launch.

For further security, the complete source code will remain private until we finish the auditing process.

Join the pack, fellow wolves!

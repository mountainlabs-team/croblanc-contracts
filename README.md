# Croblanc

CROBLANC is a DeFi Yield aggregator exclusively available on Cronos that comes on top of the most famous platforms such as VVSFinance, CronaSwap and Crodex, offering various types of pools:

- Stochastic yield: the emission speed of CROBLANC tokens depends on its market price, in order to keep it sustainable
- Classic pools, offering a dual yield CROBLANC + VVS/CRONA/CRX
- Autocompound pools, offering an auto compounding similar to Autofarm but with extra CROBLANC yield
- Autoswap pools, offering an innovative way to farm A-tier tokens such as BTC, ETH, CRO with stablecoins deposits.

CROBLANC also offers to its hodlers dividends paid in $CROBLANC that comes from a small performance fee that is charged on the generated yield. The supply is limited to 100 million tokens.
